## why?

The link (to another site) on the [intti.fi](https://intti.fi/arvomerkit-hierarkia) article about learning ranks is broken/doesn't load properly on my computer so I made this instead.
Also I thought this was a fun way to learn React.


To play this locally

```
git clone https://github.com/Turbonator0/rankguessing-game
cd rankguessing-game

npm run dev
