## why?

The link (to another site) on the [intti.fi](https://intti.fi/arvomerkit-hierarkia) article regarding ranks is broken/doesn't load properly on my computer so I made this instead.
Also I thought this was a fun way to learn React.


To play this locally

```
git clone https://github.com/Turbonator0/rankguessing-game
cd rankguessing-game
npm i
npm run dev
```

Future features:
- Add plates (currently only M05 strips are used (ranks OF-3, 4 and 5 are almost identical to OF1 and OF2), plates add a border to the senior ranks)
